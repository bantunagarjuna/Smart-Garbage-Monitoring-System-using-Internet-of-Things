The working of a smart dustbin is based on a combination of various sensors and technologies to 
monitor and manage waste more efficiently. The device allows setting an alarm with the details of the 
geographical location and the quantity of the waste present in the dustbin. The device uses GPS and 
Ultrasonic sensors to detect the amount of wastage and location of the particular dustbin.


The Ultrasonic sensor emits high-frequency sound waves that bounce off the waste present in the
dustbin, and the time taken by the waves to return is measured to calculate the distance to the waste. 
Based on the distance, the amount of waste present in the dustbin is determined.


The GPS sensor is used to track the location of the dustbin. By collecting this information, we can track 
each individual dustbin and manage the waste collection more effectively. The data collected by the 
sensors is sent to the cloud platform, such as Thingspeak, where the data is stored

Using cloud-based storage, we can store the daily details of the wastage present in the particular area. 
This information can be used to plan the waste management activities more efficiently. The device 
allows us to collect the wastage in an efficient way by reducing the transportation charges. The device 
can send the details of each dustbin by considering the amount of waste present in that particular 
dustbin. If the amount of waste is above the threshold value, it will send alerts to the waste management 
members.

By using the gas sensor, the smart dustbin can monitor the air quality in and around the dustbin. The 
gas sensor can detect the presence of harmful gases and send alerts to the waste management team to 
take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the environment and people.
